TL; DR &#8211; [f.lux website][1].

Winter is coming&#8230; which means the sun is going down earlier, and if you get used to working in the evening this tip might be useful for you.

Using a laptop (or any other active screen for that matter) late at night can mess up the sleep cycle. This is because the eye thinks that a screen is a sun and decides it&#8217;s still morning so there&#8217;s a full day ahead and for the next 16 hours you should stay awake.

The cells responsible for that are called [photosensitive retinal ganglion cells][2] and unlike rods and cones, they are especially sensitive to violet and blue light. This explains why normal electrical light bulbs do not interfere with them but monitors do.

It&#8217;s recommended by sleep specialists to avoid any screens 1 hour before going to bed but if you need to then this program can decrease the negative effect. It&#8217;s called [f.lux][1] and it&#8217;s designed to shift screen [color temperature][3] to the yellow part of the spectrum whenever the sun is down.

To show you the difference, these photos were made in a room with no windows, only the LED light, with white balance set at 3400k (Halogen light)

The configuration is pretty simple, you set your location  
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-954 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/ruslanbes.com/devblog/rbes-content/uploads/2017/10/flux-location.png?resize=385%2C467&#038;ssl=1" alt="f.lux location" width="385" height="467" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/devblog.ruslanbes.com/rbes-content/uploads/2017/10/flux-location.png?w=385&ssl=1 385w, https://i1.wp.com/devblog.ruslanbes.com/rbes-content/uploads/2017/10/flux-location.png?resize=247%2C300&ssl=1 247w" sizes="(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> 

and pick the type of light:

<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956" src="https://i1.wp.com/ruslanbes.com/devblog/rbes-content/uploads/2017/10/flux-lighttype.png?resize=478%2C289&#038;ssl=1" alt="f.lux light type" width="478" height="289" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/devblog.ruslanbes.com/rbes-content/uploads/2017/10/flux-lighttype.png?w=478&ssl=1 478w, https://i0.wp.com/devblog.ruslanbes.com/rbes-content/uploads/2017/10/flux-lighttype.png?resize=300%2C181&ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> 

and that&#8217;s all, f.lux will load the sun cycles for your area and adjust the screen

<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957" src="https://i2.wp.com/ruslanbes.com/devblog/rbes-content/uploads/2017/10/flux-screen.png?resize=554%2C243&#038;ssl=1" alt="f.lux screenshot" width="554" height="243" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/devblog.ruslanbes.com/rbes-content/uploads/2017/10/flux-screen.png?w=554&ssl=1 554w, https://i0.wp.com/devblog.ruslanbes.com/rbes-content/uploads/2017/10/flux-screen.png?resize=300%2C132&ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> 

I also set the transition speed to &#8220;slow&#8221; as it makes working more comfortable

<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958" src="https://i2.wp.com/ruslanbes.com/devblog/rbes-content/uploads/2017/10/flux-settings.png?resize=554%2C243&#038;ssl=1" alt="f.lux settings" width="554" height="243" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/devblog.ruslanbes.com/rbes-content/uploads/2017/10/flux-settings.png?w=554&ssl=1 554w, https://i0.wp.com/devblog.ruslanbes.com/rbes-content/uploads/2017/10/flux-settings.png?resize=300%2C132&ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> 

If you have several monitors, f.lux will affect all of them using the same settings (it&#8217;s not possible to configure different temperatures for each monitor).

If you&#8217;re interested, there is also a short Coursera course from University of Michigan regarding [Sleep Deprivation][5], it doesn&#8217;t mention f.lux but mentions other features related to a good sleep.
